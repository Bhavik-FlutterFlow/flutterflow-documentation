# App Builder

On opening the project, you'll see the App Builder, which consists of four main sections: Navigation Menu, Toolbar, Canvas, and Properties panel.

## 1. Navigation Menu

The [Navigation Menu](navigation-menu) provides access to the project's widget palette, widget tree, storyboard, and features like Firestore, API calls, asset uploads, app values, integrations, custom functions, theme settings, and more.

## 2. Tool Bar

From [Tool Bar](toolbar), you can search for project resources, change canvas size, see project history, branching, optimization and enhancements, view-download code, and run your app.

## 3. Canvas Area

In the [Canvas Area](canvas), you can see a preview of your mobile device's screen and build your app page.

## 4. Properties Panel

The [Properties Panel](properties-panel) is present on the right side of the canvas. It displays all the properties you can customize for the selected widget or page.
