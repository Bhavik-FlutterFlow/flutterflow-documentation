On opening the project, you'll see the App Builder, which consists of four main sections: [Navigation Menu](#navigation-menu), [Toolbar](#toolbar), [Canvas](#canvas-area), and [Properties panel](#properties-panel).

## 1. Navigation Menu {#navigation-menu}

The [Navigation Menu](navigation-menu) provides access to the project's widget palette, widget tree, storyboard, and features like Firestore, API calls, asset uploads, app values, integrations, custom functions, theme settings, and more.

## 2. Tool Bar {#toolbar}

From [Tool Bar](toolbar), you can search for project resources, change canvas size, see project history, branching, optimization and enhancements, view-download code, and run your app.

## 3. Canvas Area {#canvas-area}

In the [Canvas Area](canvas), you can see a preview of your mobile device's screen and build your app page.

## 4. Properties Panel {#properties-panel}

The Properties Panel lets you modify both the visual appearance and interactive behavior of UI elements on the canvas. It allows you to add [Actions](#), set up a [Backend Query](#), add [Animations](#) and more.
