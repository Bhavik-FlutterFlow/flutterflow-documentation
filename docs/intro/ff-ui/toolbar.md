## 6. Project history

Versions

Versions enable you to save specific named states of your project. This function is particularly useful for recovery purposes. If you accidentally delete a page or component or change settings, you can easily revert to a saved version.

Snapshots

Snapshots are automatically saved as you build.

:::info

Users on the *Free* and *Standard* plans can access only one day of snapshots.

:::

### 6.1 Saving a version

Saving the latest changes will store the current state of your app in the version control. In the future, if anything goes wrong, you can restore your app to the currently saved state.

Ideally, you should save the version whenever you accomplish something important, for example, after finishing a page, adding configuration, etc.

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'
}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/d1rO0YLeMsrIt3Alb70E?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title="Sharing a Project with a User"
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>
### 6.2 Restoring a version

Restoring the previous version will preserve the current version, then load the changes from the version you're restoring. Before restoration, you may want to view the changes in the previous version. To do this, select the Peek option, which opens the previous version in a new tab.
