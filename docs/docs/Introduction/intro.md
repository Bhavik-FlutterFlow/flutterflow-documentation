# Introduction

Welcome To FlutterFlow Docs!

## What is FlutterFlow?

FlutterFlow is a low-code builder for developing native mobile applications. You can use our simple drag-and-drop interface to build your app 10x faster than traditional development.

## System Requirements

FlutterFlow is a web app that can be used from your browser. Please review these system requirements for the best experience:

- Building on any laptop or desktop is currently supported.
- Using a screen that is at least **1280 x 1084** is recommended.
- FlutterFlow works best on **Google Chrome** (if you are experiencing any issues, we recommend switching to Chrome).
- [Allow pop-up and redirects and ClipBoard](/troubleshooting/miscellaneous#i-cant-copy-paste-widgets.) from app.flutterflow.io.
