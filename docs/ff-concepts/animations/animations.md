Enhancing your app with animations significantly improves the user experience, making it more engaging and intuitive. In FlutterFlow, you have several options to add animations to your app:

- **Widget Animations**: Add animation effects to an entire widget.
- **Implicit Animations**: Animate changes in specific widget properties, such as the height of a Container.
- **Hero Animations**: Animate a widget that transitions smoothly between screens, also known as shared element transitions.
- **Page Transitions**: Specify transitions between pages within your app.
- **Import Animations**: Import animations you've created using other tools such [lottiefiles](https://lottiefiles.com/) and [Rive](https://rive.app/).
