# Flex

The **Flex** widget can be used as an alternative to **Rows** and **Columns**, which allows you to dynamically set the layout axis (horizontal or vertical) based on specific conditions or logic. This is useful in scenarios where the layout needs to adapt to different screen sizes or device orientations.

For instance, the Flex widget can lay out items horizontally on wider screens and switch to a vertical layout when screen space is limited, ensuring an optimal user experience on any device.

:::tip[Possible use cases]

- **Responsive Dashboards**: In admin dashboards, the Flex widget can adjust charts, tables, and stats based on screen size or orientation.
- **Profile Layouts**: In social media profiles, the Flex widget can arrange pictures, usernames, and stats.
- **Cards Layout:** In credit card management apps, Flex can be used to layout credit cards dynamically, switching between a horizontal or vertical layout based on screen width.

## Adding Flex Widget

To use the Flex widget, add it from the **Layout Elements**, then add child widgets inside it. Then, from the properties panel, set a condition for the **Is Horizontal** property. When this condition evaluates to TRUE, the items will be laid out horizontally.

Consider an e-commerce app where recent orders are displayed vertically on mobile devices and switch to a horizontal layout on larger screens to make better use of the available space.

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/3zWIgGDDec21fNIeCVOU?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title=""
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>
<p></p>

Here's another example of using a Flex widget on a create account page to dynamically align the signup fields based on screen size.

<div style={{
    position: 'relative',
    paddingBottom: 'calc(56.67989417989418% + 41px)', // Keeps the aspect ratio and additional padding
    height: 0,
    width: '100%'}}>
    <iframe 
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/HPk574WhIatWbJBdlxtf?embed&show_copy_link=true"
        title=""
        style={{
            position: 'absolute',
            top: 0,
            left: 0,
            width: '100%',
            height: '100%',
            colorScheme: 'light'
        }}
        frameborder="0"
        loading="lazy"
        webkitAllowFullScreen
        mozAllowFullScreen
        allowFullScreen
        allow="clipboard-write">
    </iframe>
</div>
<p></p>

:::tip[Best Practices]

- If you only need a simple vertical or horizontal arrangement, consider usingÂ [**Row**](../../../resources/ui/widgets/composing-widgets/rows-column-stack.md) or [**Column**](../../../resources/ui/widgets/composing-widgets/rows-column-stack.md).
- For very large numbers of children, consider using [**ListView**](../../../resources/ui/widgets/composing-widgets/list-grid.md#listview-widget) or [**GridView**](../../../resources/ui/widgets/composing-widgets/list-grid.md#gridview-widget) instead of **Flex**, as they offer better performance for scrolling large lists of items.
- When the content exceeds the screen limit, you can enable scrolling to make the content accessible. However, if you want to avoid scrolling altogether and still fit all the content on the screen, consider using a [**Wrap**](wrap-widget.md) widget.

## Customization

When **Is Horizontal** property is disabled, the Flex widget behaves like a Column, and when enabled, it acts as a Row. Settings like [main axis alignment](../../../resources/ui/widgets/composing-widgets/rows-column-stack.md#main-axis), [cross axis alignment](../../../resources/ui/widgets/composing-widgets/rows-column-stack.md#cross-axis), [scrollability](../../../resources/ui/widgets/composing-widgets/rows-column-stack.md#scrollability), and [spacing](../../../resources/ui/widgets/composing-widgets/rows-column-stack.md#spacing) works the same way they do for the Column and Row widgets.
